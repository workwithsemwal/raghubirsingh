        <p align="justify">
          I have a rich experience of in the compliances of Social Safeguard Norms. The World Bank's social safeguard
          policies are a cornerstone of its support to sustainable poverty reduction. The objective of these policies is
          to prevent and mitigate undue harm to people in the development process. The effectiveness and development
          impact of projects and programs supported by the Bank has substantially increased as a result of attention to
          these policies.

          Safeguard policies have often provided a platform for the participation of stakeholders in project design, and
          have been an important instrument for building ownership among local populations. The Social Development team
          members for the Latin America and Caribbean region not only review Bank-financed projects to ensure that they
          meet social safeguard standards, but they also provide training in safeguard policies, revise policy, and
          facilitate the dissemination of best practices.

        <p align="justify">
          I have been a rich experience of building the capacity of 81 Municipal Corporations, Councils and Committees
          of Haryana State Under Swachh Bharat Mission Urban Project. Capacity Building (or capacity development,
          capacity strengthening) is the improvement in an individual's or organization's facility (or capability) "to
          produce, perform or deploy". The terms capacity building and capacity development have often been used
          interchangeably, although a publication by OECD-DAC stated in 2006 that capacity development was the
          preferable term, international organizations, governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
          communities use the concept of capacity building as part of "social and economic development" in national and
          sub national plans. The United Nations Development Programme defines itself by "capacity development" in the
          sense of "'how UNDP works" to fulfill its mission. The UN system applies it in almost every sector, including
          several of the Sustainable Development Goals to be achieved by 2030. For example, the Sustainable Development
          Goal 17 advocates for enhanced international support for capacity building in developing countries to support
          national plans to implement the 2030 Agenda

        <p align="justify">
          I have enough experience in Community Engagement at grassroot level and motivate them to be part of the main
          stream. A community engagement strategy is the method brands can use to encourage engagement from their
          community members.
          Community engagement is the way in which individuals interact and co-create within a group. In virtual
          communities, members contribute, learn, and share with others in the community by posting, commenting and
          liking content in a group.
          A community engagement strategy has the ability to create, enhance, and sustain social ties among community
          members. It can also increase community membersâ€™ sense of belonging and commitment to the community.
          Read on to find out more about the importance of community engagement and the benefits you can expect from a
          good community engagement strategy.
